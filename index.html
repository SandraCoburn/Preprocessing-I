      <h2>My Story...</h2>
      <p>Many years ago, I got my Associates Degree in Computer Information Systems. I worked for a couple of years and then decided to stay home to raise my 5 children. Last year I decided to give programming career a second chance. I enrolled at Lambda School where I remembered once more why I love programming. Intensive program but I learned so much. Ready to apply my knowledge building amazing websites!</p>
